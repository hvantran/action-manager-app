### 1.2 Introduction

I had the idea for an "Action Manager Service" to fulfill my own needs. Specifically, I wanted the ability to complete tasks using Java programming language and receive notifications or emails with the results. The service allows for tasks to be run immediately without the need for compilation and also supports the scheduling of both one-time and recurring jobs.
